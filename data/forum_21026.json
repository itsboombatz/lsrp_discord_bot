Many of us still see potential and the purpose of this thread is for the community to work together to find solutions. There will always be differing opinions and as such no one will ever be 100% satisfied but that shouldn't stop us from having a constructive discussion about the best path forward for LSRP.\u00a0\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t\u00a0\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tPlease stay on topic.\n</p>\n", "hidden": false, "url": "https://community.ls-rp.com/forums/topic/21026-a-vision-for-the-future/?do=findComment&comment=198828"}, {"id": 198846, "item_id": 21026, "author": {"id": 549, "name": "Michael_Dippolito", "title": null, "formattedName": "Michael_Dippolito", "primaryGroup": {"id": 3, "name": "Members", "formattedName": "Members"}, "joined": "2021-10-01T04:30:12Z", "reputationPoints": 211, "photoUrl": "https://community.ls-rp.com/uploads/monthly_2024_05/373290.jpg.cda0623389bba844be436ec406b136d6.jpg", "photoUrlIsDefault": false, "coverPhotoUrl": "https://community.ls-rp.com/uploads/monthly_2024_05/2psq6vp.jpg.03af7e291df8b549939c8fe21067da55.jpg", "profileUrl": "https://community.ls-rp.com/profile/549-michael_dippolito/", "posts": 63, "lastActivity": "2024-10-28T07:26:23Z", "birthday": null, "profileViews": 1124, "customFields": {"7": {"name": "Staff Position", "fields": {"7": {"name": "Rank", "value": null}}}, "1": {"name": "Connect With Me", "fields": {"1": {"name": "About Me", "value": ""}, "3": {"name": "Discord", "value": ""}, "4": {"name": "Ingame Name", "value": ""}}}, "9": {"name": "Misc", "fields": []}}, "rank": {"id": 6, "name": "Collaborator", "icon": {"seoPagination": null, "base": "none", "data": {"scheme": "https", "host": "community.ls-rp.com", "port": null, "user": null, "pass": null, "path": "/uploads/monthly_2021_09/deagle.png.e3de2012cad753d2721a86b096f46ff8.png", "query": "", "fragment": null}, "queryString": [], "hiddenQueryString": []}, "points": 800}, "achievements_points": 919}, "date": "2024-10-27T21:26:22Z", "content": "<p>\n\tI think everyone in here needs to call up their barber and get their hairlines fixed.

Despite the past between us, I am proud to have taken part in this faction. In the last few weeks, you have seen a degree of increase in your activity, but it's a shame that it ended like this.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<br>\n\tThis topic is emotionally charged, and it affects almost every user who comments here. Before posting anything incorrect to influence other readers, do a self-evaluation. Yes, the server is not at its peak, but the number of players still justifies its existence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<br>\n\tI've also had a tough time here in the last few months, but we have to keep going because it's just a video game. Try not to fool other players or stick to them that the server is leaning over and these are his last days.\u00a0\n</p>\n", "hidden": false, "url": "https://community.ls-rp.com/forums/topic/21026-a-vision-for-the-future/?do=findComment&comment=198899"}]
